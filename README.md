# Machine-Learning-Spring24
Completed a series of labs covering core machine learning techniques:
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) implementation
- Clustering techniques (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering)
-	Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis - PCA)
-	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implementation
-	Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)

## Notable Projects:
### Midterm Project - AVAZU CTR Prediction:
Participated in the [AVAZU CTR Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avazu-ctr-prediction/overview) Kaggle competition, focusing on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering (e.g. hashed the categorical features)
- Model predictions using:
  - Logistric Regression
  - XGboost
  - MLP
- Hyperparameter tuning and performance comparison across models

### Final Project - Reinforcement learning: CartPole:
- 	Developed a reinforcement learning agent to solve the CartPole problem using neural networks
- Enhanced agent performance through policy gradient techniques, discounted rewards, and hyperparameter tuning
- Addressed non-Markovian environment behavior by incorporating historical state information, achieving stable convergence over extended training sessions
